                <!-- "REQUIRED" PART FOR FORM VALIDATION:
                 Client-side form validation. When implemented, the browser performs 
                 tests before the form data is sent to the server. If any of those tests 
                 fail, the user is informed of what went wrong and what action they should 
                 take to fix the error.

                  Commonly used attribute is required. It ensures that a form field is filled 
                  in (has a value) before the form can be submitted. It’s a Boolean, so we don’t 
                  need to use required="true". Including the attribute inside the input tag is sufficient
                  -->

                  <!-- Also, another part of validation is called constraint validation:
                    which is accomplished by specifying the type of an input (for example, 
                    <input type="email" />) and through other validation-related attributes.
                    Another commonly used attribute is required.-->
            </div>

            <br>

            <!-- We need a submit button. -->
             <!-- When a <button type="submit"> inside a <form> element 
                is clicked, it will submit the form data to the 
                URL designated by the form’s action attribute. In this 
                example, "/the-form-submits-here" is a placeholder URL; 
                therefore, clicking submit doesn’t submit the data anywhere. -->
